## Introduction

Vue Naive Admin is a minimalist admin template with a full-stack solution. The front-end is built with Vite + Vue 3 + Pinia + Unocss, and the back-end uses NestJS + TypeORM + MySQL. It's easy to use and visually clean. The project has gone through many refactors and polish cycles to provide a practical starter for admin interfaces.

## Design Philosophy

The Vue Naive Admin project went open-source in February 2022. From v1.0 to v2.0 it follows the principle "simplicity is virtue". It aims to help small teams, students, and solo developers quickly start admin projects. To lower the learning curve, the front-end is implemented in JavaScript (not TypeScript), making this project one of the few Vue 3 admin templates that use JavaScript while still offering a polished experience.

## Features

- üÜí Modern Vue 3 stack: Vite + Vue 3 + Pinia
- üçá Atomic CSS with Unocss ‚Äî elegant, lightweight, and easy to use
- üçç Pinia for state management with optional persistence
- ü§π Icon system based on iconify + unocss, supports custom icons and dynamic rendering
- üé® Built with Naive UI for a simple and clean code style and UI; themes are easy to customize
- üëè Clear, well-organized file structure with low coupling between modules ‚Äî removing a single business module won't affect others
- üöÄ Flat route design: each component can be a page, avoiding multi-level router KeepAlive issues
- üçí Dynamic routes generated from permissions; 403 and 404 pages are handled separately
- üîê Integrates session refresh (e.g., Redis-backed) for seamless login state handling and better UX
- ‚ú® Global message utilities wrapped around Naive UI, supporting batch notifications and singleton cross-page behavior
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Common business components (Page, CRUD table, Modal, etc.) are pre-wrapped for faster development and less duplication

## What's new in 2.0 vs 1.0

- v2.0 is a ground-up redesign inspired by v1.0; while they may look similar, the code structure in v2.0 is significantly different.
- v1.0 provided only a front-end with mocked back-end data. v2.0 is full-stack and includes real back-end API examples.
- Although the version number is higher, v2.0 aims to be simpler and more flexible than v1.0.
- v2.0 offers higher flexibility ‚Äî you can customize layouts per page if needed.

## NestJS Back-end

This project provides a reference back-end using NestJS + TypeORM + MySQL. It includes JWT, RBAC, and basic APIs commonly needed by the template.

Note: A common question is how to add or modify menus. Menu resources are controlled by the back-end, so after connecting to a back-end you should use the resource management feature to add/update/delete menus, then grant permissions in the role management screen. For details about back-end integration, see the project documentation. If you prefer not to control some menus via permissions, you can add `basePermissions` in `/src/settings.js` to align with your menu resource structure (refer to the API docs for structure details).
