# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Overview

The Incident Management System is an open-source, self-hosted platform designed to manage the full incident lifecycle for organizations using Prometheus and Alertmanager. It provides a modern web interface for incident tracking, alert grouping, and real-time notifications across multiple channels.

## Problem Statement

Organizations using Prometheus and Alertmanager often lack a comprehensive incident management solution that:
- Provides a user-friendly interface for incident tracking
- Automatically groups related alerts into incidents
- Offers real-time notifications via multiple channels
- Tracks key metrics like MTTA (Mean Time To Acknowledge) and MTTR (Mean Time To Resolve)
- Supports escalation policies and on-call scheduling
- Integrates seamlessly with existing monitoring infrastructure

## Solution

A web-based incident management system that:
- Receives webhooks from Alertmanager
- Automatically groups alerts into incidents based on configurable rules
- Provides a dashboard for real-time incident monitoring
- Supports incident lifecycle management (create, acknowledge, resolve)
- Sends notifications via Slack, Email, and Telegram
- Tracks and reports on incident metrics
- Includes frameworks for escalation policies and on-call scheduling

## Target Audience

- DevOps/SRE teams managing infrastructure monitoring
- Organizations using Prometheus/Alertmanager stack
- Teams requiring incident response coordination
- Open-source communities seeking self-hosted solutions
